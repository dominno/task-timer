# Project Status

## Completed Features
- ARCH-001: Establish Project Architecture and Module Boundaries
- ARCH-002: Define Storage Abstraction Layer (Strategy Pattern)
- ARCH-003: Domain Model — TaskSession Entity & Lifecycle
- ARCH-004: CLI Command Routing Skeleton
- FEAT-001: Implement JSON Storage Provider
- FEAT-002: Implement TaskSession Lifecycle Logic
- FEAT-003: Implement CLI Command Logic (Start, Pause, Resume, Stop, Status)
- FEAT-004: Implement Summary Reporting (Today, Week, Month, Year) - Functionally complete; pending linting pass.

## In Progress
- FEAT-005: Export Data to JSON/CSV ([FEAT-005])
    - ✅ Define export logic (JSON & CSV in StorageProvider & JsonStorage)
    - ✅ Add CLI command for export (ExportCommand with argparse)
    - ✅ Write unit tests (Core logic for storage and CLI command)
    - ⏳ Status/log updates (this step)

## Pending
- TEST-001: Enforce Unit Testing and Coverage Standards
- TECH-DEBT-001: Configure Flake8 and Black Alignment
- FEAT-IMPRV-001: Add TaskSession.create_from_json factory method
- FEAT-IMPRV-002: Implement Robust Logging in Storage Layer
- LINT-001: Resolve all outstanding flake8 errors project-wide (New)


## Known Issues
- Test flakiness with `freezegun` when running full test suite (affects `tests/domain/test_session.py`).
- Numerous `flake8` E501 (line too long) errors across multiple files.

## Decision History
- 2025-01-18 14:00 - FEAT-002 - Decided to use segmented accumulation for TaskSession duration and store pause/resume times for accurate reporting. Alternatives considered: Storing only total accumulated duration (simpler but less flexible for reporting).
- 2025-05-07 11:54 - FEAT-004 - Deferred full project linting for FEAT-004 completion to a new task (LINT-001) to unblock progress to FEAT-005. FEAT-004 is functionally complete. Alternatives considered: Blocking progress on FEAT-005 until all linting for FEAT-004 is resolved.

## Next Steps
- Begin FEAT-005: Export Data to JSON/CSV.
- Prioritize LINT-001.

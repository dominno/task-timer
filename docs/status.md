# Project Status

## Completed Features
- Establish Project Architecture and Module Boundaries (ARCH-001)
- Define Storage Abstraction Layer (Strategy Pattern) (ARCH-002)
- Domain Model ‚Äî TaskSession Entity & Lifecycle (ARCH-003)
- CLI Command Routing Skeleton (ARCH-004)
- Implement JSON Storage Provider (FEAT-001)
- Implement TaskSession Lifecycle Logic (FEAT-002)

## In Progress
- Implement CLI Command Logic (Start, Pause, Resume, Stop, Status) (FEAT-003)
  - ‚úÖ Implement each command to interact with domain and storage
  - ‚úÖ Validate CLI args and error handling
  - ‚úÖ Write unit tests (happy path, invalid input, storage errors)
  - üèóÔ∏è Status/log updates

## Pending
- Implement Summary Reporting (Today, Week, Month, Year) (FEAT-004)
- Export Data to JSON/CSV (FEAT-005)
- Enforce Unit Testing and Coverage Standards (TEST-001)
- Add TaskSession.create_from_json factory method (FEAT-IMPRV-001)
- Implement Robust Logging in Storage Layer (FEAT-IMPRV-002)

## Known Issues
- [Issue ID or description, optional link to bug/task]

## Decision History
- 2025-05-06 17:14 ARCH-001 ‚Äî Initial project structure and scaffolding completed as per architecture.mermaid and technical.md. Alternatives considered: None, followed defined plan.
- 2025-05-06 17:30 TECH-DEBT-001 ‚Äî Deferred task 'Configure Flake8 and Black Alignment'. Rationale: Workaround (`flake8 --max-line-length=88`) is sufficient for now, allowing progress on core features. To be addressed before wider collaboration or CI integration. Alternatives: Implement immediately (would delay ARCH-003).

## Next Steps
- Complete status/log updates for FEAT-003.

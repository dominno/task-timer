## TECH-DEBT-001: Configure Flake8 and Black Alignment
Status: Planned
Priority: Low
Architectural Module: Devops/Tooling
Dependencies: None

### üìù Description
Currently, `flake8` and `black` have different default line length configurations (79 vs 88 characters). This led to manual adjustments of the `flake8` command during ARCH-002. To ensure consistency and avoid future manual overrides:

1.  Create a `.flake8` configuration file in the project root.
2.  Set `max-line-length = 88` in `.flake8` to align with `black`'s default.
3.  Consider adding other project-wide linting rules to this file as needed.
4.  Ensure `black` is also configured consistently if its defaults are ever changed (e.g., via `pyproject.toml`).

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
1.  `.flake8` configuration file exists.
2.  `flake8` runs without `--max-line-length` argument and respects the 88 char limit.
3.  `black` and `flake8` produce compatible formatting regarding line length.

### üßê Impact
- Improves developer experience by ensuring consistent linting.
- Simplifies CI setup.
- Reduces noise from conflicting linter/formatter defaults.

## FEAT-IMPRV-001: Add TaskSession.create_from_json factory method
Status: Planned
Priority: Low
Architectural Module: domain
Dependencies: FEAT-001
PRD Reference: None (Internal improvement suggested during ARCH-003 review)

### üìù Description
As a forward-thinking measure suggested during the review of ARCH-003, implement a class method `TaskSession.create_from_json(cls, data: dict) -> TaskSession`.

This method will be responsible for deserializing a dictionary (presumably from a JSON object) into a `TaskSession` instance.

This task should be tackled after or alongside FEAT-001 (Implement JSON Storage Provider) as it directly relates to how `TaskSession` objects are reconstructed from JSON data.

### üîß Implementation Plan
- [ ] Define the signature for `TaskSession.create_from_json(cls, data: dict) -> TaskSession`.
- [ ] Implement basic deserialization logic (handle `task_name`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `status`, `_duration_override`).
- [ ] Ensure proper type conversion (e.g., ISO date strings to datetime objects).
- [ ] Write unit tests for various valid and invalid input data scenarios.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
1. `TaskSession.create_from_json` method is implemented.
2. Method correctly deserializes valid dictionary representations of a `TaskSession`.
3. Method handles potential errors or missing keys gracefully (e.g., raises ValueError, or has clear default logic).
4. Unit tests cover main success and failure paths.

### üßê Impact
- Encapsulates deserialization logic within the domain model.
- Improves maintainability when JSON structure or TaskSession model evolves.
- Provides a clear interface for reconstructing TaskSession objects from storage.

## FEAT-IMPRV-002: Implement Robust Logging in Storage Layer
Status: Planned
Priority: Low
Architectural Module: infra/storage
Dependencies: FEAT-001
PRD Reference: None (Internal improvement suggested during FEAT-001 review)

### üìù Description
The current error handling in `JsonStorage` (and potentially future storage providers) uses commented-out print statements for issues encountered during file load/save operations (e.g., `JSONDecodeError`, `IOError`). While it prevents crashes by returning default values or passing, it silences important diagnostic information.

This task is to implement proper logging using Python's `logging` module within the storage layer.

### üîß Implementation Plan
- [ ] Configure a basic logger for the `infra.storage` module (or a more general application logger if available).
- [ ] In `JsonStorage._load_sessions_from_file`, replace commented-out prints with `logger.error()` or `logger.warning()` calls when exceptions are caught, detailing the error and file path.
- [ ] In `JsonStorage._save_sessions_to_file`, do the same if `StorageWriteError` is caught at a higher level, or log before raising.
- [ ] Ensure log messages are informative and provide context.
- [ ] Consider log levels (e.g., `ERROR` for failed saves, `WARNING` or `INFO` for recoverable load issues like empty/new file).

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
1. Python's `logging` module is used for error/warning reporting in `JsonStorage`.
2. Critical file I/O or parsing errors are logged with sufficient detail.
3. Commented-out diagnostic `print` statements related to error handling are removed from `JsonStorage`.
4. Tests are not expected to assert on log messages directly unless a specific logging test framework is introduced, but the code should demonstrate proper logger usage.

### üßê Impact
- Greatly improves diagnosability of storage issues in user environments.
- Centralizes error reporting instead of relying on `print` statements.
- Aligns with best practices for application development.
